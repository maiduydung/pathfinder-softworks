 Business Stakeholder Optimized

Rewrite and refine the Pathfinder Softworks landing page copy.

Target reader

Business owners, founders, and operations leaders at SMEs

Non-technical decision-makers

They care about cost, visibility, reliability, and risk — not tools

Primary objective

Make the reader feel understood

Make the work feel low see it low-risk

Make the outcome feel concrete and business-relevant

Tone & voice

Calm, grounded, business owner -to-business owner

Plain language, no jargon

Confident but not salesy

Sounds like someone who has helped businesses clean up internal messes before

Language rules

Prefer business language over technical language
(e.g. “reliable numbers” instead of “ETL data pipelines”)

If technical terms appear, keep them secondary and unobtrusive

Short sentences. Simple structure.

Avoid

Engineering jargon (ETL, observability, microservices, etc.)

Consultant buzzwords (“unlock value”, “leverage”, “synergy”)

Grand vision statements

Over-explaining how the technology works

Founder section guidance

Present the founder as a practical problem-solver, not a technologist

Emphasize lived experience with:

unclear numbers

broken internal systems

slow decisions

hidden costs

Mention Vietnam → scholarship → Japan → Tokyo career briefly, as credibility

Focus on why this background helps businesses, not technical depth

Positioning

Not a long-term hire

Not a big agency

A focused Software Agency who:

comes in

finds what’s actually wrong

fixes it

leaves things clearer and more stable than before

Overall goal
The reader should think:

“This company understands how businesses like mine break as they grow — and I trust them to fix it without drama.”
