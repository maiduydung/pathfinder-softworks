					Hi, I'm Mai. I run Pathfinder Softworks.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm from Vietnam. I got out through scholarships and engineering, not connections.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started my career in Japan as a machine learning engineer. From the outside, it looked solid: good salary, stable job, clear path. Inside, I saw how often smart teams were stuck working around broken data, unclear systems, and decisions made with half the picture.
				</p>
				<p>
					That experience shaped how I work now.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since then, I've built data and software systems for teams in Tokyo, Shanghai, Vancouver, New York, and San Francisco — mostly startups and ops-heavy businesses that needed things to actually work, not just look good in a deck.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm not a consultant. I don't sell frameworks.
				</p>
				<p>
					I come in, understand how your business actually runs, fix what's broken, and leave you with systems your team can own.
